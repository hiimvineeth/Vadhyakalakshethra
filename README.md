This project is aimed at the development of traditional arts and artists .We can book and buy the
instruments using this website. There are so many talented artists in our society but there is no
any website to promote their talents. Vadyakalakshetra is a web portal which promotes our local
talented artists. Today a lot of traditional art is facing trouble to survive in field. There is no
website for artist to focus on local performance. Here,we are giving support to them by giving a
web portal which helps to get bookings and popularity. This will help to survive their struggles.
There are mainly three modules in this project. User module, Admin module and Artist module.
Admin can add and delete the information about the vadyams (instruments). The user can register
and login to the website and search for different vadyams (instruments) and can also search about
the details of artist. User can also book the artists and vadyams (instruments) using this website.
Artist can register and login in to the website and they can also add events. The proposed website
is realized using the features of JavaScript,CSS and HTML as frontend and SQLAlchemy as
backend
